Data Cleanup & Analysis

Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

•	The sources of data that you will extract from.
1.	Goodreads API
2.	The Guardian – Top 100 Books of All Time


•	The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
1.	Cleaning – Dropping columns, dropping duplicates, renaming columns.
2.	Joining – Joining two tables to match goodreads average rating to top 100 books table.
3.	Filtering – Filter by goodreads average rating
4.	Aggregating – none


•	The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
1.	Relational: PostgreSQL – pgAdmin


•	The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.
1.	Goodreads API Average Rating Table
2.	Top 100 Books of All Time


You will be required to submit a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce your ETL process.
